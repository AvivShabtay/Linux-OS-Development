# Multi-threading using Producer-Consumer approach
* Using Linux OS to create multi-threading application.
* Defining thread-pool to complete tasks.
* The parent process used as the task-producer and the worker-threads as the consumers in Producer-Consumer approach.
* Access to critical sections is done by pthread-mutex & pthread-condition structures.
* Multi-threadind is done by pthread library.
* Have fun!
